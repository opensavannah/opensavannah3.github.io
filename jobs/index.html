  <h2>Help build a stronger organization</h2>
  <p>
    Code for San Francisco is a collection of creative volunteers
    working to improve the lives of San Franciscans. We continue to
    advocate for open public data, we continue to build useful civic
    apps like Adopt-a-Drain and We Vote, and we continue to
    work on civic infrastructure like Lighten.
  </p>
  <p><b>But <u>we want to do more</u> and to do it better.</b> To that end, we are building our leadership team.</p>
  <p>The positions on the teams below are unpaid volunteer positions, but the work is rewarding and a lot of fun. Get in on building an entirely new model of civic engagement and action. You can apply into a team and indicate interest in either leading or supporting the team. Each team will have one leader ultimately responsible for delivering on the vision, but will likely be supported by several others in that work. While the teams support core, important functions of the Brigade, all core team members will work collaboratively together across teams as well. Read more about the teams below and apply using the form to the right.</p>
